  A post about literate programming in general and Quarto formats in particular to
  document migrating this personal blog from
  [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
  Compared to *J.J. Allaire's Distill for R Markdown*, **PositÂ® Quarto Markdown** uses
  a new templating system built on top of [Bootstrap
  v5.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/overview/) with new page layout
  features, extended export formats, and more flexible (Sensible) publishing
  workflows. This post briefly outlines my process for creating a custom Bootstrap
  theme for this revamped website, and few design tweaks I have made along the way.

::: {.aside .shaded .p-2 .mt-md-n5 .mb-md-3}
No reason for this map aside from showcasing Quarto's content layout features, and well, I {{< fa heart size=xs >}} Russian topographic maps. Check out Soviet-era [cartography](https://www.sovietmaps.com/), it's stunning work.

This margin note uses a custom `DIV` with markdown `{.aside .shaded .p-2 .mt-md-n5 .mb-md-3}`. It makes use of Boostrap's new negative margins and grid breakpoints.

With the release of **Quarto 1.4**, markdown-based publishing is gaining popularity, way beyond the scientific community. Multilingual text-based documents (such as **Emacs org-mode**, **Rmarkdown** and **Jupyter** notebooks) that combine executable code chunks with formatted prose greatly simplify the process of drafting, iterating, generating, documenting, sharing and reproducing computable research experiments.

Old-time researchers and engineers have long used **Emacs `Org-Mode`**[^sw] along with its wild hordes of keyboard shortcuts[^kb] to achieve similar results thanks to *Eric Schulte*'s incredible **babel** extension to `Org-Mode` [see @schulte2012] and to *John MacFarlane*'s [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) document converter library -- but nowadays Quarto makes use of more efficient parsers and optimized runtime engines (Sass, Deno, V8) as well as **in-browser real-time rendering of documents**.

[^sw]: For folks born in this century, to **babel** (elips) or to **sweave** (R) is the process of compiling text documents that include both static markup and compile-time executable scripts.

    The concept of **Literate programming** was introduced in 1984 by the mathematician [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) and was widely popularized thereafter in the engineering community thanks to [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/uses.html) in the Emacs editor.

    ![](Carsten-Dominik.jpg){width="10em" .img-rounded}
  
    Emacs **`Org-Mode`** was created by the astronomer [Carsten Dominik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode#:~:text=Org%20Mode%20was%20created%20by,mode%20by%20default%20since%202006) in 2003 and remains to this day one of the most used and madly loved note-taking and GTD (Get-Things-Done) tools, with many of its functionality (agenda, tags, etc.) yet to be ported to any markdown engine.
    
[^kb]: Only keyboard, Baby!

As I migrate my old articles and code notebooks to the new Quarto markdown syntax, this post outlines the process of creating a full Bootstrap theme for this revamped website. I am using content on this page to fine tune placement and execution. Feel free to reuse my `www/theme-labs.scss` Sass file and other tidbits.


# CSS Grid System

One of the many great features of Quarto is that the framework uses the full flexibility of the Bootstrap v5.3 grid system, with a few handy classes to help precisely position content on a page, in particular:

- 2 predefined (column-based) page layouts:
  - `page-layout: full` (home page)
  - `page-layout: article` (this document), and
- 6 column classes to control content width (shown below)
- 2 margin classes to shift content into the left or right column (like that XKCD comics):
  - `<div class="column-margin">`, and
  - `<span class="aside">` 
- 8 classes to overflow content into the left or right margin

For example I use Quarto `{.column-screen}` CSS class to place a flushed banner directly below the post header, as a way to highlight static or dynamic content. Here is the R code chunk to achieve this, which output inside a `<div class="column-screen">` element, like the map above.

```{{r}}
#| column: screen

library(leaflet)
leaflet(width="100%", height="15em") %>% addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(-8.65406047010657, 41.14426475811268, 
    label="Me, as I'm writing this post. Read on, tips below!", 
    labelOptions=labelOptions(textsize="1rem"))
```

Grid sizing and spacing are defined in `_quarto.yml` and may also be modified on a per-document basis, for example by setting:

```.md
#| filename: ./_quarto.yml
#| eval: false 

grid:
  body-width: 900px
  sidebar-width: 160px
  margin-width: 240px
  gutter-width: 2em
```


There are new Quarto CSS classes to help control content width and placement.

:::{.column-body .striped .mb-2}
.column-body
:::

:::{.column-body-outset .striped .mb-2}
.column-body-outset
:::

:::{.column-page .striped .mb-2}
.column-page
:::

:::{.column-page-inset .striped .mb-2}
.column-page-inset
:::

:::{.column-screen .striped .mb-2}
.column-screen
:::

:::{.column-screen-inset-shaded .mb-4}
.column-screen-inset-shaded
:::

Finally any layout is achievable using stackable `<div class="g-col-{width}">` CSS-Grid columns inside `<div class="grid">` elements (see color boxes below). The full system summarized here, copied straight from Quarto documentation[^doc].

# Color Scheme

Choosing a color scheme is relatively easy -- you can start from your favorite photo
or graphic and upload it to one of the many on-line **color palette generators** to
extract base and accent colors. Below I have selected a standard 12-color palette that
simply strives to complement my decade old [Kubuntu
desktop](https://store.kde.org/p/1980663)[^kde] (albeit in a light version). Another
remarkable tool I have used in the past to generate sensible UI color schemes is
[thermer.dev](https://themer.dev/)[^themer] -- this online masterpiece will generate
consistent color schemes for Linux desktops and for many consoles, text editors, and
IDEs.

[^kde]: KDE, 30 years later, still going strong!

# Block Elements

Simple indented blockquote with (small) credits.

> Blockquote title  
> Blockquote content comes here...   
> <small>-- Author</small>

Bootstrap built-in **callout block** and **card** components are readily available in Quarto Markdown with the usual semantic colors.

::: {.callout}
Note that there are 6 types of callout blocks, including:
`default`, `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
This is the **default** callout style.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
This is a **note**.
:::

```markdown
::: {.callout-tip}
### Callout title
This is an example of a **tip** callout with a title.
:::
```

::: {.callout-tip}
### Callout title
This is an example of a **tip** with a title.
:::

```markdown
::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Expand to learn about collapse
This is an example of a 'collapsible' **caution** callout
:::
```

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Expand to learn about collapse

This is an example of a "folded" **caution** callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Important"}
This is a callout with a title.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Warning"}
This is an **important** callout with a title.
:::


# Typography

Bootstrap default line-height and font sizing typically work, but I like to enforce a strict vertical grid whenever possible, so I make sure to define all vertical spacing and padding as multiple of a standard line height of `$spacer` (22px). 

```{sass}
#| eval: false
#| filename: ./www/theme-mblabs.scss

$spacer: 22px;
$spacers: (
  0: 0,
  1: $spacer * .25,
  2: $spacer * .5,
  3: $spacer * 1,
  4: $spacer * 1.5,
  5: $spacer * 2,
);

$line-height-base: 1.375;                  // 22px (tighten vertical space)
$headings-line-height: 1.375;
$list-inline-padding: .5* $spacer;

$font-size-base: 1rem;                     // 16px in `_quarto.yml`
$h1-font-size:  $font-size-base * 2.000;
$h2-font-size:  $font-size-base * 1.500;
$h3-font-size:  $font-size-base * 1.500;
$h4-font-size:  $font-size-base * 1.750;
$h5-font-size:  $font-size-base * 1.0625;  // 20px
$h6-font-size:  $font-size-base;
```

No additional changes to font definitions aside from using `Source Sans Pro`, `Oswald`, and `Roboto Condensed` fonts. This is how **bold**, *italic*, and <small>smaller</small> text spans. Here is ^superscript^ and ~subscript~ text, and ~~strikethrough~~ notes. Semantic colors with e.g. <span class="text-info">.text-info</span> provide accented text. I have added 2 background classes for my own use, a semi-transparent and blurred <span class="shaded">`.shaded`</span> and a <span class="striped">`.striped`</span>. I use <span class="text-muted">.text-muted</span> for all post metadata, end and margin notes, and for captioning.

## Heading 2

Sample paragraph content.

### Heading 3

Sample paragraph content with list of items:

- List 1
- List 2
- List 3

Ordered list:

#. List 1  
#. List 2  
#. List 3

Below a normal rule `<hr/>` and a section `div.separator` elements.

----------

::: {.separator}
:::

#### Heading 4

Sample paragraph content.

> Blockquote title  
  Blockquote content comes here...   
  <small>-- Author</small>
  
Sample paragraph content after blockquote.

##### Heading 5

Sample paragraph content.

Here is a footnote reference[^1] and another much longer one[^ln]. Caption and footnote placement can be controlled in the config files `_quarto_yml` and/or `_metadata.yml`, or directly in the YAML front matter.

[^1]: Here is a short margin note (footnote).

[^ln]: Here's one with multiple paragraph blocks.

    With subsequent paragraphs indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

# Tables

I prefer my tables slightly more condensed than Bootstrap default settings and to resemble LaTeX typesetting, so a few simple changes here:

|        |        |
|--------|--------|
| apple  | 2.05   |
| pear   | 1.37   |
| orange | 3.09   |

: Caption: my default table spacing

| fruit  | price  |
|--------|--------|
| apple  | 2.05   |
| pear   | 1.37   |
| orange | 3.09   |

: Caption: Smaller spacing borderless hover sm {.borderless .hover .sm}

| fruit  | price  |
|--------|--------|
| apple  | 2.05   |
| pear   | 1.37   |
| orange | 3.09   |

: Caption: striped hover sm {.striped .hover .sm}

| fruit  | price  |
|--------|--------|
| apple  | 2.05   |
| pear   | 1.37   |
| orange | 3.09   |

: Caption: striped hover sm secondary {.striped .hover .sm .secondary}

```{r}
#| column: page
#| tbl-cap: A full-width table to increase content space

knitr::kable(mtcars[1:6, 1:10])
```


# Apply Themed Colors to R Graphics

I make use of R `thematic::thematic_on()` package to auto-generate `base graphics`, `lattice` and `ggplot2` color palettes that match my Bootstrap color scheme.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Specify your sequential and qualitative palettes
thematic::thematic_on(
  bg = "transparent", fg = "#505050", accent = pal["cyan"],
  font = font_spec("Roboto Condensed"),
  sequential = sequential_gradient(fg_weight=.5, bg_weight=.5, fg_low=FALSE),
  qualitative = alpha(pal[1:12], .85)
  )
```

Note that calling `thematic_on()` modifies R session  `getOption("ggplot2.discrete.colour")` and `getOption("ggplot2.discrete.fill")` -- and that's how the underlying "magic" happens.

Next I apply (slightly opinionated) changes to `ggthemes::theme_foundation()`, mostly transparent fills, condensed font, simplified axes, and a y-axis on the right side.

These graphic customizations are further documented in `./R/theme.R` in this repo, so as to handle dependencies, and because I want to use them more flexibly across my blog posts. Obviously when visualizing scientific and spatial datasets the choice of color scales requires good care, so the use of `thematic_on()` is often not sufficient, but it's a good start here nonetheless.

```{r filename="./R/theme.R"}
#| file: ../../R/theme.R
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show all code"
#| eval: false

```

Let's generate a couple of categorical and continuous `ggplot` and `lattice` charts below simply to make sure everything looks adequate.

```{r}
# Apply and check my new graphic theme
library(mblabs)
library(ggplot2)
theme_labs_on()
```

```{r}
#| classes: preview-image

ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(carb), mpg, fill=factor(carb))) + geom_col() +
  guides(y=guide_none(), y.sec=guide_axis()) +
  labs(
    title="My Long and Descriptive Plot Title", 
    subtitle="My very long subtitle with many units", 
    caption="My very long plot caption with many references.") +
  theme_labs()
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color=carb)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  guides(y=guide_none(), y.sec=guide_axis()) +
  labs(
    title="My Long and Descriptive Plot Title", 
    subtitle="My very long subtitle with many units", 
    caption="My very long plot caption with many references.") +
  theme_labs()
```

Note that the code chunk below produces a PNG instead of SVG file. I also set `knitr fig-dpi: 220` option globally in `_quarto.yml` so plots still look decent when printed to paper (though of course it's not adequate on long pages with many plots). 

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| fig-format: png

gglabs(faithfuld, aes(waiting, eruptions, z=density)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill=density)) +
  geom_contour()
```

```{r}
gglabs(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color=factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point(size=4) +
  labs(title="My Title", subtitle="My Subtitle", caption="My plot caption")
```

Note that `thematic_on()` also does a little magic with R graphics `par()` options. This is important as many advanced statistical and spatial libraries in R continue to favor base R `graphics` library.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: A sample histogram in base R to demo my new color scheme

lattice::show.settings()

x <- rchisq(100, df=4)
hist(x, freq=FALSE, ylim=c(0, 0.2), col=1:11, border=12, xlab=NA)
grid(NA, NULL, col=4)
curve(dchisq(x, df=4), col=2, lty=2, lwd=2, add=TRUE)
```

# Publishing Workflow

The latest Quarto release adds perfectly sensible options to optimize everyone's publishing workflow, in particular through the use of **Draft** and **Freeze** features:

- `draft: true`
  Tells Quarto that a document may (or may not) be listed / accessible to viewers, and prevents automatic re-tangling.
  
- `freeze: true`
  Tells Quarto to only re-tangle a document on content change, and not every time a site is rebuilt.
