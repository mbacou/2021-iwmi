@article{Popovs2015,
abstract = {This paper presents a semi-automatic approach adapted to the modelling of the geological structure of sedimentary basins. The modelling approach is based on developing the algorithm of the main geological processes so that the geometrical relationship is automatically defined between model elements. The algorithm is based on the assumption that sedimentary basins are formed as a result of the repeated sequence of sedimentation, faulting and erosion. This approach allows of successful modelling of the geological structure of the sedimentary basins with limited data coverage: stratigraphic intervals from well logs describing the thicknesses of sedimentary strata and a limited amount of structural data. Sedimentary layers are handled by modelling assuming non-eroded thickness distribution and using geometrical adjustment from the known fault displacements. As a result geometrical relationships of the model layers are deduced automatically in the presence of unconformities. An application of this methodology, a 3D geological model of Latvia, the central part of the Baltic Basin, is presented. The results show that this model is geologically reasonable for achieving the structural and stratigraphic concepts.},

abstract = {Modern scientific visualization is web-based and uses emerging technology such as WebGL (Web Graphics Library) andWebGPU for three-dimensional computer graphics andWebXR for augmented and virtual reality devices. These technologies, paired with the accessibility of websites, potentially offer a user experience beyond traditional standalone visualization systems. We review the state-of-the-art of web-based scientific visualization and present an overview of existing methods categorized by application domain. As part of this analysis, we introduce the Scientific Visualization Future Readiness Score (SciVis FRS) to rank visualizations for a technology-driven disruptive tomorrow. We then summarize challenges, current state of the publication trend, future directions, and opportunities for this exciting research field.},

@article{Hssaisoune2020,
abstract = {In semi-arid areas, many ecosystems and activities depend essentially on water availability. In Morocco, the increase of water demands combined to climate change induced decrease of precipitation put a lot of pressure on groundwater. This paper reports the results of updating and evaluation of groundwater datasets with regards to climate scenarios and institutional choices. The continuous imbalance between groundwater extraction and recharge caused a dramatic decline in groundwater levels (20 to 65 m in the past 30 years). Additionally, Morocco suffers from the degradation in groundwater quality due to seawater intrusion, nitrate pollution and natural salinity changes. Climate data analysis and scenarios predict that temperatures will increase by 2 to 4◦C and precipitation will decrease by 53% in all catchments over this century. Consequently, surface water availability will drastically decrease, which will lead to more extensive use of groundwater. Without appropriate measures, this situation will jeopardize water security in Morocco. In this paper, we zoom on the case the Souss-Massa basin, where management plans (artificial recharge, seawater desalination, and wastewater reuse) have been adopted to restore groundwater imbalance or, at least, mitigate the recorded deficits. These plans may save water for future generations and sustain crop production.},

abstract = {The visualization of a three-dimensional (3D) distribution of high-density data for scientific computations with limited computing resources under a network environment is difficult. This paper describes the implementation of an interactive 3D display of air pollutants in a network environment using the open-source WebGL class library, Three. js. A kd-tree is used to find the nearest point data to interpolate the 3D grid data of pollutants because the source data are scattered, which helps locate the data conveniently at the client's end. The binary file format is used to save and transfer data to reduce the number of network transmissions and to improve the speed of the image display. The results show that the visual effects and rendering speed are significantly improved on the web with the use of the proposed technology.},

@article{Liu2019,
abstract = {Despite the importance of mesoscale eddies, and other three-dimensional features discernable in numerical simulations of ocean circulations, to the understanding of oceanic heat transport and climate change, there are few dedicated three-dimensional visualization tools for scientists to use. This paper presents a framework for the visualization of three-dimensional (3D) ocean eddies in web browsers. The framework includes a feature-based eddy computation algorithm implemented by a standalone C++ program and a web graphics library-based 3D eddy viewer. Combining eddy extraction, tracking, query, and interactive visualizations in one workflow, the proposed framework is designed to facilitate the visual exploration and analysis of ocean eddies and thus help domain experts get more insight into the process of ocean circulation. In the framework, the feature-based algorithm significantly reduces the storage requirement of data and the rendering cost of visualization tasks by exploiting the coherence between consecutive data frames and focusing on just those regions of interest. The 3D eddy viewer presents eddy visualizations within a standard web browser, which enables the easy sharing of the tool and the results between scientific collaborators at different locations on diverse platforms without the need to install specialized software. In this paper, the general considerations in the design process as well as the technical facts of the framework, the application of the framework to a high-resolution regional ocean simulation, the general usage scenarios of the 3D eddy viewer and the user evaluation are discussed.},
