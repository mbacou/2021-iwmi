In the middle of reading Daniel Huffman's excellent and highly-recommended blog[^fig1], I stumbled on his audacious representation of U.S. median income across states -- Stunningly informative! This prompted me to look for comparable statistics for Russia[^fig2].

Quoting directly from Daniel's article about the many virtues of equal-area projections:

> "Here, an area’s color conveys one dataset, and its size conveys a related dataset
that provides some useful context (what portion of the country’s population lives in
those various income brackets). Our fallible human brains usually want us to
interpret some meaning from variations in the size of areas (which is always a
challenge with choropleths), so cartograms leverage that. We usually laud these
heavily-distorted choropleths that are most assuredly not equal-area."
